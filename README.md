# Advent of Code 2024

For the seventh time tried to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!
* [2022](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2022): 25 days for the third time!
* [2023](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2023): 25 days for the fourth time!

Not only am I (still) not a pro, nor do I have a degree in computer science, but also this is a pretty challenging time for me. So I'm totally not sure how much effort I can devote to AoC this year. But let's try anyone. 

As every year, shoutout to the wonderful [AoC community on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2024:

* [Day 1 Python](01/d01.py): reading comprehension (because I tried to solve a much harder puzzle for about 20 minutes...) and collections.Counter (**R**)
* [Day 2 Python](02/d02.py): zip on the same list to create pairs for the first attempt (**R**), and pop(idx) (**R**) for a far too complicated solution, because I over-worried about edge cases
* [Day 3 Python](03/d03.py): using logical operators in regex (**I**)
* [Day 4 Python](04/d04.py): operations on numpy arrays (rotate, diagonals) (**I**)
* [Day 5 Python](05/d05.py): set operations (**R**) and writing custom comparator for functools.cmp_to_key (**R**)
* [Day 6 Python](06/d06.py): storing grids in dictionaries (**R**)
* [Day 7 Python](07/d07.py): BFS (**R**) and Python operator (**R**) for a solution that's inefficient, but works; recursion (**I**) for an improved and much faster solution
* [Day 8 Python](08/d08.py): set operations (**R**)
* [Day 9 Python](09/d09.py): OH GOSH, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT. Spent far too many hours debugging a seemingly simple solution, ended up refreshing itertools.cycle (**R**), deques (**R**) and thinking with pointers (**R**) before figuring out where the bug was
* [Day 10 Python](10/d10.py): iterative DFS (**R**)
* [Day 11 Python](11/d11.py): that you don't have to store everything that you count, just like [twice](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021/blob/main/06/d06.py) in [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021/blob/main/14/d14.py) (**R**)
* [Day 12 Python](12/d12.py): BFS (**R**), finding islands in 2d grid (**R**) and finding sides of a 2D polygon (**L**)
* [Day 13 Python](13/d13.py): linear algebra (**I**) and Cramer's rule (**L**)
* [Day 14 Python](14/d14.py): using modulo (**R**) and matplotlib (**R**) for a buggy solution what didn't make it to the final one
