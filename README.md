# Advent of Code 2024

For the seventh time tried to find out how far I can make it in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/). Results for previous editions:
* 2018: 9 days
* 2019: 13 days
* [2020](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2020): 25 days for the first time!
* [2021](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2021): 25 days for the second time!
* [2022](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2022): 25 days for the third time!
* [2023](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2023): 25 days for the fourth time!

Not only am I (still) not a pro, nor do I have a degree in computer science, but also this is a pretty challenging time for me. So I'm totally not sure how much effort I can devote to AoC this year. But let's try anyone. 

As every year, shoutout to the wonderful [AoC community on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

Things I **L**earned, **R**evised or **I**mproved at in 2024:

* [Day 1 Python](01/d01.py): reading comprehension (because I tried to solve a much harder puzzle for about 20 minutes...) and collections.Counter (**R**)
* [Day 2 Python](02/d02.py): zip on the same list to create pairs (**R**) and pop(idx) (**R**) for a far too complicated solution, because I over-worried about edge cases
